      is an interactive query service that
   makes it easy to analyze data in Amazon S3 using standard SQL. Athena is serverless, so there is no
   infrastructure to manage, and you pay only for the queries that you run.
     </p>
     <p>
      Athena is easy to use. Simply point to your data in Amazon S3, deﬁne the schema, and start
   querying using standard SQL. Most results are delivered within seconds. With Athena, there’s no
   need for complex extract, transform, and load (ETL) jobs to prepare your data for analysis. This
   makes it easy for anyone with SQL skills to quickly analyze large-scale datasets.
     </p>
     <p>
      Athena is out-of-the-box integrated with AWS Glue Data Catalog, allowing you to create a unified
   metadata repository across various services, crawl data sources to discover schemas and populate
   your Catalog with new and modified table and partition definitions, and maintain schema
   versioning.

      is a service that makes it easy to

   that stores all your data, both in its original form and prepared for analysis. A data lake
   enables you to break down data silos and combine different types of analytics to gain insights
   and guide better business decisions.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, setting up and managing data lakes today involves a lot of manual, complicated, and
   time-consuming tasks. This work includes loading data from diverse sources, monitoring those data
   flows, setting up partitions, turning on encryption and managing keys, defining transformation
   jobs and monitoring their operation, re-organizing data into a columnar format, configuring
   access control settings, deduplicating redundant data, matching linked records, granting access
   to data sets, and auditing access over time.
     </p>
     <p>
      Creating a data lake with Lake Formation is as simple as defining where your data resides and what
   data access and security policies you want to apply. Lake Formation then collects and catalogs data from
   databases and object storage, moves the data into your new Amazon S3 data lake, cleans and classifies
   data using ML algorithms, and secures access to your sensitive data. Your users can then access a
   centralized catalog of data which describes available data sets and their appropriate usage. Your
   users then leverage these data sets with their choice of analytics and ML services, such as Amazon EMR
   for Apache Spark, Amazon Redshift, Amazon Athena, SageMaker, and Amazon QuickSight.

      (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides
      secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale computing
      easier for developers.
     </p>
     <p>
      The simple web interface of Amazon EC2 allows you to obtain and configure capacity with
      minimal friction. It provides you with complete control of your computing resources and lets
      you run on Amazon’s proven computing environment. Amazon EC2 reduces the time required to obtain
      and boot new server instances (called Amazon EC2 instances) to minutes, allowing you to quickly
      scale capacity, both up and down, as your computing requirements change. Amazon EC2 changes the
      economics of computing by allowing you to pay only for capacity that you actually use. Amazon EC2
      provides developers and system administrators the tools to build failure resilient
      applications and isolate themselves from common failure scenarios.

     <p>
      EC2 Image Builder significantly reduces the effort of keeping images up-to-date and secure by
      providing a simple graphical interface, built-in automation, and AWS-provided security

      tools, and offers optimized performance for Amazon EC2 Graviton-based instances and AWS Support at no
      additional licensing cost. Starting with AL2023, a new Amazon Linux major release will be
      available every two years. This cadence provides you with a more predictable release cycle and
      up to 5 years of support, making it easier for you to plan your upgrades.
     </p>
     <p>
      AL2023 offers several improvements over Amazon Linux 2 (AL2). For example, AL2023 takes a
      security-by-default approach to help improve your security posture with preconfigured security
      policies, SELinux in permissive mode and IMDSv2 enabled by default, and the availability of
      kernel live patching. With deterministic upgrades through versioned repositories, you can lock
      to a specific version of the Amazon Linux package repository, giving you control over how and
      when you absorb updates. With this capability, you can adhere to operational best practices
      more efficiently by ensuring consistency between package versions and updates across your
      environment. For a full comparison, refer to

      without having
      to manage servers or clusters. With AWS Fargate, you no longer have to provision, configure,
      and scale clusters of VMs to run containers. This removes the need to choose server types,
      decide when to scale your clusters, or optimize cluster packing. Fargate removes the need
      for you to interact with or think about servers or clusters. Fargate lets you focus on
      designing and building your applications instead of managing the infrastructure that runs
      them.
     </p>
     <p>
      Amazon ECS has two modes: Fargate launch type and EC2 launch type. With Fargate launch
      type, all you have to do is package your application in containers, specify the CPU and memory
      requirements, define networking and IAM policies, and launch the application. EC2 launch
      type allows you to have server-level, more granular control over the infrastructure that runs
      your container applications. With EC2 launch type, you can use Amazon ECS to manage a cluster of
      servers and schedule placement of containers on the servers. Amazon ECS keeps track of all the CPU,
      memory and other resources in your cluster, and also finds the best server for a container to
      run on based on your specified resource requirements.
     </p>
     <p>
      You are responsible for provisioning, patching, and scaling clusters of servers. You can
      decide which type of server to use, which applications and how many containers to run in a
      cluster to optimize utilization, and when you should add or remove servers from a cluster. EC2
      launch type gives you more control of your server clusters and provides a broader range of
      customization options, which might be required to support some specific applications or
      possible compliance and government requirements.

      (Amazon RDS) on VMware lets you deploy
   managed databases in on-premises VMware environments using the Amazon RDS technology enjoyed by
   hundreds of thousands of AWS customers. Amazon RDS provides cost-efficient and resizable capacity
   while automating time-consuming administration tasks including hardware provisioning, database
   setup, patching, and backups, freeing you to focus on your applications. Amazon RDS on VMware brings
   these same benefits to your on-premises deployments, making it easy to set up, operate, and scale
   databases in VMware vSphere private data centers, or to migrate them to AWS.
     </p>
     <p>
      Amazon RDS on VMware allows you to utilize the same simple interface for managing databases in
   on-premises VMware environments as you would use in AWS. You can easily replicate Amazon RDS on
   VMware databases to Amazon RDS instances in AWS, enabling low-cost hybrid deployments for disaster
   recovery, read replica bursting, and optional long-term backup retention in Amazon Simple Storage Service
   (Amazon S3).

      is a fully managed ledger database that
   provides a transparent, immutable, and cryptographically verifiable transaction log owned by a
   central trusted authority. Amazon QLDB tracks each and every application data change and maintains
   a complete and verifiable history of changes over time.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ledgers are typically used to record a history of economic and financial activity in an
   organization. Many organizations build applications with ledger-like functionality because they
   want to maintain an accurate history of their applications' data, for example, tracking the
   history of credits and debits in banking transactions, verifying the data lineage of an insurance
   claim, or tracing movement of an item in a supply chain network. Ledger applications are often
   implemented using custom audit tables or audit trails created in relational databases. However,
   building audit functionality with relational databases is time-consuming and prone to human
   error. It requires custom development, and since relational databases are not inherently
   immutable, any unintended changes to the data are hard to track and verify. Alternatively,
   blockchain frameworks, such as Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum, can also be used as a ledger.
   However, this adds complexity as you need to set-up an entire blockchain network with multiple
   nodes, manage its infrastructure, and require the nodes to validate each transaction before it
   can be added to the ledger.
     </p>
     <p>
      Amazon QLDB is a new class of database that eliminates the need to engage in the complex
   development effort of building your own ledger-like applications. With QLDB, your data’s change
   history is immutable – it cannot be altered or deleted – and using cryptography, you can easily
   verify that there have been no unintended modifications to your application’s data. QLDB uses
   an immutable transactional log, known as a journal, that tracks each application data change and
   maintains a complete and verifiable history of changes over time. QLDB is easy to use because it
   provides developers with a familiar SQL-like API, a flexible document data model, and full
   support for transactions. QLDB is also serverless, so it automatically scales to support the
   demands of your application. There are no servers to manage and no read or write limits to
   configure. With QLDB, you only pay for what you use.

      is a fast, scalable, fully managed
   time series database service for IoT and operational applications that makes it easy to store and
   analyze trillions of events per day at 1/10th the cost of relational databases. Driven by the
   rise of IoT devices, IT systems, and smart industrial machines, time series data — data that
   measures how things change over time — is one of the fastest growing data types. Time-series data
   has specific characteristics such as typically arriving in time order form, data is append-only,
   and queries are always over a time interval. While relational databases can store this data, they
   are inefficient at processing this data as they lack optimizations such as storing and retrieving
   data by time intervals.
     </p>
     <p>
      Timestream is a purpose-built time series database that efficiently stores and processes this
   data by time intervals. With Timestream, you can easily store and analyze log data for DevOps, sensor
   data for IoT applications, and industrial telemetry data for equipment maintenance. As your data
   grows over time, the Timestream adaptive query processing engine understands its location and format,
   making your data simpler and faster to analyze. Timestream also automates rollups, retention,
   tiering, and compression of data, so you can manage your data at the lowest possible cost. Timestream
   is serverless, so there are no servers to manage. It manages time-consuming tasks such as server
   provisioning, software patching, setup, configuration, or data retention and tiering, freeing you
   to focus on building your applications.

      makes it easy to create, configure,
   and implement scalable mobile applications powered by AWS. Amplify seamlessly provisions and
   manages your mobile backend and provides a simple framework to easily integrate your backend with
   your iOS, Android, Web, and React Native frontends. Amplify also automates the application
   release process of both your front-end and back-end allowing you to deliver features faster.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mobile applications require cloud services for actions that can’t be done directly on the
   device, such as offline data synchronization, storage, or data sharing across multiple users. You
   often have to configure, set up, and manage multiple services to power the backend. You also have
   to integrate each of those services into your application by writing multiple lines of code.
   However, as the number of application features grow, your code and release process becomes more
   complex and managing the backend requires more time.
     </p>
     <p>
      Amplify provisions and manages backends for your mobile applications. You just select the
   capabilities you need such as authentication, analytics, or offline data sync, and Amplify will
   automatically provision and manage the AWS service that powers each of the capabilities. You
   can then integrate those capabilities into your application through the Amplify libraries and
   UI components.

      is a fully-managed service that makes
   it easy to run and operationalize sophisticated analytics on massive volumes of IoT data without
   having to worry about the cost and complexity typically required to build an IoT analytics
   platform. It is the easiest way to run analytics on IoT data and get insights to make better and
   more accurate decisions for IoT applications and machine learning use cases.
     </p>
     <p>
      IoT data is highly unstructured which makes it difficult to analyze with traditional
   analytics and business intelligence tools that are designed to process structured data. IoT data
   comes from devices that often record fairly noisy processes (such as temperature, motion, or
   sound). The data from these devices can frequently have significant gaps, corrupted messages, and
   false readings that must be cleaned up before analysis can occur. Also, IoT data is often only
   meaningful in the context of additional, third party data inputs. For example, to help farmers
   determine when to water their crops, vineyard irrigation systems often enrich moisture sensor
   data with rainfall data from the vineyard, allowing for more efficient water usage while
   maximizing harvest yield.
     </p>
     <p>
      AWS IoT Analytics automates each of the difficult steps that are required to analyze data from IoT
   devices. AWS IoT Analytics filters, transforms, and enriches IoT data before storing it in a time series data
   store for analysis. You can setup the service to collect only the data you need from your
   devices, apply mathematical transforms to process the data, and enrich the data with
   device-specific metadata such as device type and location before storing the processed data.
   Then, you can analyze your data by running ad hoc or scheduled queries using the built-in SQL
   query engine, or perform more complex analytics and machine learning inference. AWS IoT Analytics makes
   it easy to get started with machine learning by including pre-built models for common IoT use
   cases.
     </p>
     <p>
      You can also use your own custom analysis, packaged in a container, to run AWS IoT Analytics. AWS IoT Analytics
   automates the running of your custom analyses created in Jupyter Notebook or your own tools (such
   as Matlab, Octave, and so on) to be run on your schedule.
     </p>
     <p>
      AWS IoT Analytics is a fully managed service that operationalizes analyses and scales automatically to
   support up to petabytes of IoT data. With AWS IoT Analytics, you can analyze data from millions of devices
   and build fast, responsive IoT applications without managing hardware or infrastructure.

   data identifying more complicated circumstances than expected, such as changes in equipment when
   a belt is stuck or connected motion detectors using movement signals to activate lights and
   security cameras. To detect events before AWS IoT Events, you had to build costly, custom applications to
   collect data, apply decision logic to detect an event, and then start  another application to
   react to the event. Using AWS IoT Events, it’s simple to detect events across thousands of IoT sensors
   sending different telemetry data, such as temperature from a freezer, humidity from respiratory
   equipment, and belt speed on a motor, and hundreds of equipment management applications. You
   simply select the relevant data sources to ingest, define the logic for each event using simple
   ‘if-then-else’ statements, and select the alert or custom action to run when an event occurs.
   AWS IoT Events continuously monitors data from multiple IoT sensors and applications, and it integrates
   with other services, such as AWS IoT Core and AWS IoT Analytics, to enable early detection and unique insights
   into events. AWS IoT Events automatically initiates alerts and actions in response to events based on the

      is a managed service that
   makes it easy to collect, store, organize and monitor data from industrial equipment at scale to
   help you make better, data-driven decisions. You can use AWS IoT SiteWise to monitor operations across
   facilities, quickly compute common industrial performance metrics, and create applications that
   analyze industrial equipment data to prevent costly equipment issues and reduce gaps in
   production. This allows you to collect data consistently across devices, identify issues with
   remote monitoring more quickly, and improve multi-site processes with centralized data.
     </p>
     <p>
      Today, getting performance metrics from industrial equipment is challenging because data is
   often locked into proprietary on-premises data stores and typically requires specialized
   expertise to retrieve and place in a format that is useful for analysis. AWS IoT SiteWise simplifies
   this process by providing software running on a gateway that resides in your facilities and
   automates the process of collecting and organizing industrial equipment data. This gateway
   securely connects to your on-premises data servers, collects data, and sends the data to the
   AWS Cloud. AWS IoT SiteWise also provides interfaces for collecting data from modern industrial
   applications through MQTT messages or APIs.
     </p>
     <p>
      You can use AWS IoT SiteWise to model your physical assets, processes and facilities, quickly
   compute common industrial performance metrics, and create fully managed web applications to help
   analyze industrial equipment data, reduce costs and make faster decisions. With AWS IoT SiteWise, you
   can focus on understanding and optimizing your operations, rather than building costly in-house
   data collection and management applications.

      A microcontroller (MCU) is a single chip containing a simple processor that can be found in
   many devices, including appliances, sensors, fitness trackers, industrial automation, and
   automobiles. Many of these small devices could benefit from connecting to the cloud or locally to
   other devices. For example, smart electricity meters need to connect to the cloud to report on
   usage, and building security systems need to communicate locally so that a door will unlock when
   you badge in. Microcontrollers have limited compute power and memory capacity and typically
   perform simple, functional tasks. Microcontrollers frequently run operating systems that do not
   have built-in functionality to connect to local networks or the cloud, making IoT applications a
   challenge. FreeRTOS helps solve this problem by providing both the core operating system (to run
   the edge device) as well as software libraries that make it easy to securely connect to the cloud
   (or other edge devices) so you can collect data from them for IoT applications and take action.

     </p>
     <p>
      Companies today use everything from simple spreadsheets to complex financial planning
   software to attempt to accurately forecast future business outcomes such as product demand,
   resource needs, or financial performance. These tools build forecasts by looking at a historical
   series of data, which is called time series data. For example, such tools may try to predict the
   future sales of a raincoat by looking only at its previous sales data with the underlying
   assumption that the future is determined by the past. This approach can struggle to produce
   accurate forecasts for large sets of data that have irregular trends. Also, it fails to easily
   combine data series that change over time (such as price, discounts, web traffic, and number of
   employees) with relevant independent variables such as product features and store locations.
     </p>
     <p>
      Based on the same technology used at Amazon.com, Amazon Forecast uses ML to combine time series
   data with additional variables to build forecasts. Amazon Forecast requires no ML experience to get
   started. You only need to provide historical data, plus any additional data that you believe may
   impact your forecasts. For example, the demand for a particular color of a shirt may change with
   the seasons and store location. This complex relationship is hard to determine on its own, but ML
   is ideally suited to recognize it. Once you provide your data, Amazon Forecast will automatically
   examine it, identify what is meaningful, and produce a forecasting model capable of making
   predictions that are up to 50% more accurate than looking at time series data alone.
     </p>
     <p>
      Amazon Forecast is a fully managed service, so there are no servers to provision, and no ML models

   detect and diagnose anomalies (outliers from the norm) in business and operational data, such as
   a sudden dip in sales revenue or customer acquisition rates. In a couple of clicks, you can
   connect Amazon Lookout for Metrics to popular data stores such as Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift, and Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), as well as
   third-party Software as a Service (SaaS) applications, such as Salesforce, Servicenow, Zendesk,
   and Marketo, and start monitoring metrics that are important to your business. Amazon Lookout for Metrics
   automatically inspects and prepares the data from these sources to detect anomalies with greater
   speed and accuracy than traditional methods used for anomaly detection. You can also provide
   feedback on detected anomalies to tune the results and improve accuracy over time. Amazon Lookout for Metrics

     <p>
      Installing sensors and the necessary infrastructure for data connectivity, storage,
   analytics, and alerting are foundational elements for enabling predictive maintenance. However,
   to make it work, companies have historically needed skilled technicians and data scientists to
   piece together a complex solution from scratch. This included identifying and procuring the right
   type of sensors for their use cases and connecting them together with an IoT gateway (a device
   that aggregates and transmits data). As a result, few companies have been able to successfully
   implement predictive maintenance.
     </p>
     <p>
      Amazon Monitron includes sensors to capture vibration and temperature data from equipment, a gateway
   device to securely transfer data to AWS, the Amazon Monitron service that analyzes the data for abnormal
   machine patterns using ML, and a companion mobile app to set up the devices and receive reports
   on operating behavior and alerts to potential failures in your machinery. You can start
   monitoring equipment health in minutes without any development work or ML experience required,
   and enable predictive maintenance with the same technology used to monitor equipment in Amazon

   content recommendations, tailored search results, and targeted marketing promotions. However,
   developing the ML capabilities necessary to produce these sophisticated recommendation systems
   has been beyond the reach of most organizations today due to the complexity of developing ML
   functionality. Amazon Personalize allows developers with no prior ML experience to easily build sophisticated
   personalization capabilities into their applications, using ML technology perfected from years of
   use on Amazon.com.
     </p>
     <p>

      is a service that turns text into lifelike
   speech. Amazon Polly lets you create applications that talk, enabling you to build entirely new
   categories of speech-enabled products. Amazon Polly is an Amazon artificial intelligence (AI) service
   that uses advanced deep learning technologies to synthesize speech that sounds like a human
   voice. Amazon Polly includes a wide selection of lifelike voices spread across dozens of languages, so
   you can select the ideal voice and build speech-enabled applications that work in many different
   countries.
     </p>
     <p>
      Amazon Polly delivers the consistently fast response times required to support real-time,
   interactive dialog. You can cache and save Amazon Polly speech audio to replay offline or redistribute.
   And Amazon Polly is easy to use. You simply send the text you want converted into speech to the
   Amazon Polly API, and Amazon Polly immediately returns the audio stream to your application so your application
   can play it directly or store it in a standard audio file format, such as MP3.
     </p>
     <p>
      In addition to Standard TTS voices, Amazon Polly offers Neural Text-to-Speech (NTTS) voices
   that deliver advanced improvements in speech quality through a new machine learning approach.
   Polly’s Neural TTS technology also supports a Newscaster speaking style that is tailored to news
   narration use cases. Finally, Amazon Polly Brand Voice can create a custom voice for your
   organization. This is a custom engagement where you will work with the Amazon Polly team to build an
   NTTS voice for the exclusive use of your organization.
     </p>
     <p>
      With Amazon Polly, you  pay only for the number of characters you convert to speech, and you can
   save and replay Amazon Polly generated speech. The Amazon Polly low cost per character converted, and lack of
   restrictions on storage and reuse of voice output, make it a cost-effective way to enable
   Text-to-Speech everywhere.

     </p>
     <p>
      Today, many companies manually extract data from scanned documents such as PDFs, images,
   tables, and forms, or through simple OCR software that requires manual configuration (which often
   must be updated when the form changes). To overcome these manual and expensive processes, Amazon
   Textract uses ML to read and process any type of document, accurately extracting text,
   handwriting, tables, and other data with no manual effort. Amazon Textract provides you with the
   flexibility to specify the data you need to extract from documents using queries. You can specify
   the information you need in the form of natural language questions (such as “What is the customer
   name”). You do not need to know the data structure in the document (table, form, implied field,
   nested data) or worry about variations across document versions and formats. Amazon Textract Queries
   are pre-trained on a large variety of documents including paystubs, bank statements, W-2s, loan
   application forms, mortgage notes, claims documents, and insurance cards.
     </p>
     <p>
      With Amazon Textract, you can quickly automate document processing and act on the information
   extracted, whether you’re automating loans processing or extracting information from invoices and
   receipts. Amazon Textract can extract the data in minutes instead of hours or days. Additionally, you
   can add human reviews with Amazon Augmented AI to provide oversight of your models and check sensitive
   data.

   generates predictions at the edge in milliseconds, meaning you can be notified about potential
   issues such as when damaged products are detected on a fast-moving production line, or when a
   vehicle has strayed into a dangerous off-limits zone in a warehouse. And, third-party
   manufacturers are building new AWS Panorama-enabled cameras and devices to provide even more form

   analyzes the configuration and resource utilization of your workload to identify dozens of
   defining characteristics, for example, if a workload is CPU-intensive, if it exhibits a daily
   pattern, or if a workload accesses local storage frequently. The service processes these
   characteristics and identifies the hardware resource required by the workload. Compute Optimizer infers how

   or using different configurations (such as Amazon EBS volume IOPS settings, and AWS Lambda function
   memory sizes) to offer recommendations.

      makes it easier to manage licenses
   in AWS and on-premises servers from software vendors such as Microsoft, SAP, Oracle, and IBM.
   AWS License Manager lets administrators create customized licensing rules that emulate the terms of their
   licensing agreements, and then enforces these rules when an instance of Amazon EC2 gets launched.
   Administrators can use these rules to limit licensing violations, such as using more licenses
   than an agreement stipulates or reassigning licenses to different servers on a short-term basis.
   The rules in AWS License Manager enable you to limit a licensing breach by physically stopping the instance
   from launching or by notifying administrators about the infringement. Administrators gain control
   and visibility of all their licenses with the AWS License Manager dashboard and reduce the risk of
   non-compliance, misreporting, and additional costs due to licensing overages.
     </p>
     <p>
      AWS License Manager integrates with AWS services to simplify the management of licenses across
   multiple AWS accounts, IT catalogs, and on-premises, through a single AWS account. License

      solutions bring advanced video processing and delivery technologies into your
   data center, co-location space, or on-premises facility. You can deploy AWS Elemental
   Appliances and Software to encode, package, and deliver video assets on-premises and seamlessly
   connect with cloud-based video infrastructure. Designed for easy integration with AWS Cloud
   media solutions, AWS Elemental Appliances and Software support video workloads that need to
   remain on-premises to accommodate physical camera and router interfaces, managed network
   delivery, or network bandwidth constraints.
     </p>
     <p>
      AWS Elemental Live, AWS Elemental Server, and AWS Elemental Conductor come in two variants: ready-to-deploy
   appliances, or AWS-licensed software that you install on your own hardware. AWS Elemental Link is a compact
   hardware device that sends live video to the cloud for encoding and delivery to viewers.

      is a high-quality transport service
   for live video. Today, broadcasters and content owners rely on satellite networks or fiber
   connections to send their high-value content into the cloud or to transmit it to partners for
   distribution. Both satellite and fiber approaches are expensive, require long lead times to set
   up, and lack the flexibility to adapt to changing requirements. To be more nimble, some customers
   have tried to use solutions that transmit live video on top of IP infrastructure, but have
   struggled with reliability and security.
     </p>
     <p>
      Now you can get the reliability and security of satellite and fiber combined with the
   flexibility, agility, and economics of IP-based networks using AWS Elemental MediaConnect. MediaConnect enables you to
   build mission-critical live video workflows in a fraction of the time and cost of satellite or
   fiber services. You can use MediaConnect to ingest live video from a remote event site (such as a
   stadium), share video with a partner (such as a cable TV distributor), or replicate a video
   stream for processing (such as an over-the-top service). MediaConnect combines reliable video transport,
   highly secure stream sharing, and real-time network traffic and video monitoring that allow you
   to focus on your content, not your transport infrastructure.

   DataSync to transfer data at speeds up to 10 times faster than open-source tools. DataSync uses
   an on-premises software agent to connect to your existing storage or file systems using the
   Network File System (NFS) protocol, so you don’t have write scripts or modify your applications
   to work with AWS APIs. You can use DataSync to copy data over AWS Direct Connect or internet links to AWS.
   The service enables one-time data migrations, recurring data processing workflows, and automated
   replication for data protection and recovery. Getting started with DataSync is easy: Deploy the
   DataSync agent on premises, connect it to a file system or storage array, select Amazon EFS or Amazon S3 as

   extremely reliable and cost-effective way to route users to internet applications by translating
   human-readable names, such as
      <code class="code">
       www.example.com
      </code>
      , into the numeric IP addresses, such
   as
      <code class="code">
       192.0.2.1
      </code>
      , that computers use to connect to each other. Amazon Route 53 is fully
   compliant with IPv6 as well.
     </p>
     <p>
      Amazon Route 53 effectively connects user requests to infrastructure running in AWS—such as EC2
   instances, elastic load balancers, or Amazon S3 buckets—and can also be used to route users to
   infrastructure outside of AWS. You can use Amazon Route 53 to configure DNS health checks to route
   traffic to healthy endpoints or to independently monitor the health of your application and its
   endpoints.
     </p>
     <p>
      Amazon Route 53 traffic flow makes it easy for you to manage traffic globally through a variety of
   routing types, including latency-based routing, Geo DNS, and weighted round robin—all of which
   can be combined with DNS Failover in order to enable a variety of low-latency, fault-tolerant
   architectures. Using Amazon Route 53 traffic flow’s simple visual editor, you can easily manage how
   your end users are routed to your application’s endpoints—whether in a single AWS Region or
   distributed around the globe. Amazon Route 53 also offers Domain Name Registration—you can purchase and
   manage domain names such as
      <code class="code">
       example.com

     </p>
     <p>
      Modern applications are often composed of multiple microservices that each perform a
   specific function. This architecture helps to increase the availability and scalability of the
   application by allowing each component to scale independently based on demand, and automatically
   degrading functionality when a component fails instead of going offline. Each microservice
   interacts with all the other microservices through an API. As the number of microservices grows
   within an application, it becomes increasingly difficult to pinpoint the exact location of
   errors, re-route traffic after failures, and safely deploy code changes. Previously, this has
   required you to build monitoring and control logic directly into your code and redeploy your
   microservices every time there are changes.
     </p>
     <p>
      AWS App Mesh makes it easy to run microservices by providing consistent visibility and network
   traffic controls for every microservice in an application. App Mesh removes the need to update
   application code to change how monitoring data is collected or traffic is routed between
   microservices. App Mesh configures each microservice to export monitoring data and implements
   consistent communications control logic across your application. This makes it easy to quickly
   pinpoint the exact location of errors and automatically re-route network traffic when there are
   failures or when code changes need to be deployed.

      is a cloud resource discovery service.
   With AWS Cloud Map, you can define custom names for your application resources, and it maintains the
   updated location of these dynamically changing resources. This increases your application
   availability because your web service always discovers the most up-to-date locations of its
   resources.
     </p>
     <p>
      Modern applications are typically composed of multiple services that are accessible over an
   API and perform a specific function. Each service interacts with a variety of other resources
   such as databases, queues, object stores, and customer-defined microservices, and they also need
   to be able to find the location of all the infrastructure resources on which it depends, in order
   to function. You typically manually manage all these resource names and their locations within
   the application code. However, manual resource management becomes time consuming and error-prone
   as the number of dependent infrastructure resources increases or the number of microservices
   dynamically scale up and down based on traffic. You can also use third-party service discovery
   products, but this requires installing and managing additional software and
   infrastructure.
     </p>
     <p>
      AWS Cloud Map allows you to register any application resources such as databases, queues,
   microservices, and other cloud resources with custom names. AWS Cloud Map then constantly checks the
   health of resources to make sure the location is up-to-date. The application can then query the
   registry for the location of the resources needed based on the application version and deployment
   environment.

     <p>
      Today, if you deliver applications to your global users over the public internet, your
   users might face inconsistent availability and performance as they traverse through multiple
   public networks to reach your application. These public networks are often congested and each hop
   can introduce availability and performance risk. AWS Global Accelerator uses the highly available and
   congestion-free AWS global network to direct internet traffic from your users to your
   applications on AWS, making your users’ experience more consistent.
     </p>
     <p>
      To improve the availability of your application, you must monitor the health of your
   application endpoints and route traffic only to healthy endpoints. AWS Global Accelerator improves application
   availability by continuously monitoring the health of your application endpoints and routing
   traffic to the closest healthy endpoints.
     </p>
     <p>
      AWS Global Accelerator also makes it easier to manage your global applications by providing static IP

      is a service that enables
   customers to connect their Amazon Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) and their on-premises networks to a single gateway.
   As you grow the number of workloads running on AWS, you need to be able to scale your networks
   across multiple accounts and Amazon VPCs to keep up with the growth. Today, you can connect pairs of
   Amazon VPCs using peering. However, managing point-to-point connectivity across many Amazon VPCs, without
   the ability to centrally manage the connectivity policies, can be operationally costly and
   cumbersome. For on-premises connectivity, you need to attach your AWS VPN to each individual Amazon VPC.
   This solution can be time consuming to build and hard to manage when the number of VPCs grows
   into the hundreds.
     </p>
     <p>
      With AWS Transit Gateway, you only have to create and manage a single connection from the central
   gateway in to each Amazon VPC, on-premises data center, or remote office across your network. Transit Gateway
   acts as a hub that controls how traffic is routed among all the connected networks which act like
   spokes. This hub and spoke model significantly simplifies management and reduces operational
   costs because each network only has to connect to the Transit Gateway and not to every other network. Any
   new VPC is simply connected to the Transit Gateway and is then automatically available to every other
   network that is connected to the Transit Gateway. This ease of connectivity makes it easy to scale your
   network as you grow.

   activities. Amazon Detective automatically collects log data from your AWS resources and uses machine
   learning, statistical analysis, and graph theory to build a linked set of data that enables you
   to easily conduct faster and more efficient security investigations. Amazon Detective further simplifies
   account management for security operations and investigations across all existing and future
   accounts in an organization using AWS Organizations for up to 1,200 AWS accounts.
     </p>
     <p>
      AWS security services such as Amazon GuardDuty, Amazon Macie, and AWS Security Hub, as well as partner
   security products, can be used to identify potential security issues, or findings. These services
   are really helpful in alerting you when and where there is possible unauthorized access or
   suspicious behavior in your AWS deployment. However, sometimes there are security findings that
   you would like to perform deeper investigations of the events that led to the findings to
   remediate the root cause. Determining the root cause of security findings can be a complex
   process for security analysts that often involves collecting and combining logs from many data
   sources, using extract, transform, and load (ETL) tools, and custom scripting to organize the
   data.
     </p>
     <p>
      Amazon Detective simplifies this process by enabling your security teams to easily investigate and
   quickly get to the root cause of a finding. Detective can analyze trillions of events from multiple
   data sources such as Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Flow Logs, AWS CloudTrail, and Amazon GuardDuty. Detective uses these events
   to automatically create a unified, interactive view of your resources, users, and the
   interactions between them over time. With this unified view, you can visualize all the details
   and context in one place to identify the underlying reasons for the findings, drill down into
   relevant historical activities, and quickly determine the root cause.
     </p>
     <p>
      You can get started with Amazon Detective in just a few clicks in the AWS Management Console. There is no
   software to deploy, or data sources to enable and maintain. You can try Detective at no additional
   charge with a 30-day free trial that is available to new accounts.

      Enabled with a few clicks in the AWS Management Console and easily administrated organization-wide with
   its support of AWS Organizations, Amazon GuardDuty can immediately begin analyzing billions of events across your
   AWS accounts for signs of unauthorized use. GuardDuty identifies suspected attackers through
   integrated threat intelligence feeds and machine learning anomaly detection to detect anomalies
   in account and workload activity. When potential unauthorized use is detected, the service
   delivers a detailed finding to the GuardDuty console, Amazon CloudWatch Events, and AWS Security Hub. This makes findings
   actionable and easy to integrate into existing event management and workflow systems. Further
   investigation to determine the root cause of a finding is easily accomplished by using Amazon Detective
   directly from the GuardDuty console.
     </p>
     <p>
      Amazon GuardDuty is cost effective and easy to operate. It does not require you to deploy and
   maintain software or security infrastructure, meaning it can be enabled quickly with no risk of
   negatively impacting existing application and container workloads. There are no upfront costs
   with GuardDuty, no software to deploy, and no threat intelligence feeds to enable. Furthermore, GuardDuty
   optimizes costs by applying smart filters and analyzing only a subset of logs relevant to threat
   detection, and new Amazon GuardDuty accounts are free for 30 days.

      is a new automated vulnerability management
   service that continually scans AWS workloads for software vulnerabilities and unintended
   network exposure. With a few clicks in the AWS Management Console and AWS Organizations, Amazon Inspector can be used across all
   accounts in your organization. Once started, Amazon Inspector automatically discovers running Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud
   (Amazon EC2) instances and container images residing in Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR), at any scale, and
   immediately starts assessing them for known vulnerabilities.
     </p>
     <p>
      Amazon Inspector has many improvements over Amazon Inspector Classic. For example, the new Amazon Inspector calculates a highly
   contextualized risk score for each finding by correlating common vulnerabilities and exposures
   (CVE) information with factors such as network access and exploitability. This score is used to
   prioritize the most critical vulnerabilities to improve remediation response efficiency.
   Additionally, Amazon Inspector now uses the widely deployed AWS Systems Manager Agent (SSM Agent) to eliminate the
   need for you to deploy and maintain a standalone agent to run Amazon EC2 instance assessments. For
   container workloads, Amazon Inspector is now integrated with Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) to support intelligent,
   cost-efficient, and continual vulnerability assessments of container images. All findings are
   aggregated in the Amazon Inspector console, routed to AWS Security Hub, and pushed through Amazon EventBridge to automate
   workflows such as ticketing.
     </p>
     <p>
      All accounts new to Amazon Inspector are eligible for a 15-day free trial to evaluate the service and
   estimate its cost. During the trial, all eligible Amazon EC2 instances and container images pushed to
   Amazon ECR are continually scanned at no cost.

   on-demand and automated sensitive data discovery jobs that automatically tracks changes to the
   bucket and only evaluates new or modified objects over time. Using Macie, you can detect a large
   and growing list of sensitive data types for many countries and Regions, including multiple types
   of financial data, personal health information (PHI), and personally identifiable information
   (PII), as well as custom types. Macie also continually evaluates your Amazon S3 environment to provide
   an S3 resource summary and security evaluation across all of your accounts. You can search,
   filter, and sort S3 buckets by metadata variables, such as bucket names, tags, and security
   controls like encryption status or public accessibility. For any unencrypted buckets, publicly
   accessible buckets, or buckets shared with AWS accounts outside those you have defined in
   AWS Organizations, you can be alerted to act.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the multi-account configuration, a single Macie administrator account can manage all
   member accounts, including the creation and administration of sensitive data discovery jobs
   across accounts with AWS Organizations. Security and sensitive data discovery findings are aggregated in
   the Macie administrator account and sent to Amazon CloudWatch Events and AWS Security Hub. Now using one account, you
   can integrate with event management, workflow, and ticketing systems or use Macie findings with
   AWS Step Functions to automate remediation actions. You can quickly get started with Macie using the
   30-day trial available to new accounts for S3 bucket inventory and bucket-level evaluation at no

   makes it easy to deploy essential network protections for all of your Amazon Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs). The
   service can be setup with just a few clicks and scales automatically with your network traffic,
   so you don't have to worry about deploying and managing any infrastructure. The AWS Network
   Firewall flexible rules engine lets you define firewall rules that give you fine-grained control
   over network traffic, such as blocking outbound Server Message Block (SMB) requests to prevent
   the spread of malicious activity. You can also import rules you’ve already written in common open
   source rule formats as well as enable integrations with managed intelligence feeds sourced by
   AWS Partners. AWS Network Firewall works together with AWS Firewall Manager so you can build policies based on
   AWS Network Firewall rules and then centrally apply those policies across your VPCs and accounts.

     <p>
      AWS Network Firewall includes features that provide protections from common network threats. The
   AWS Network Firewall stateful firewall can incorporate context from traffic flows, such as tracking
   connections and protocol identification, to enforce policies such as preventing your VPCs from
   accessing domains using an unauthorized protocol. The AWS Network Firewall intrusion prevention system
   (IPS) provides active traffic flow inspection so you can identify and block vulnerability
   exploits using signature-based detection. AWS Network Firewall also offers web filtering that can stop
   traffic to known bad URLs and monitor fully qualified domain names.

      Many organizations use multiple accounts to create administrative or billing isolation, and
   to limit the impact of errors. With AWS RAM, you don’t need to create duplicate resources in
   multiple AWS accounts. This reduces the operational overhead of managing resources in every
   account that you own. Instead, in your multi-account environment, you can create a resource once,
   and use AWS RAM to share that resource across accounts by creating a resource share. When you
   create a resource share, you select the resources to share, choose an AWS RAM managed permission
   per resource type, and specify whom you want to have access to the resources. AWS RAM is available
   to you at no additional charge.

       <awsui-icon class="awsdocs-link-icon" name="external">

      </a>
      provides a simple, scalable, elastic
   file system for Linux-based workloads for use with AWS Cloud services and on-premises
   resources. It is built to scale on demand to petabytes without disrupting applications, growing
   and shrinking automatically as you add and remove files, so your applications have the storage
   they need – when they need it. It is designed to provide massively parallel shared access to
   thousands of Amazon EC2 instances, enabling your applications to achieve high levels of aggregate
   throughput and IOPS with consistent low latencies. Amazon EFS is a fully managed service that requires
   no changes to your existing applications and tools, providing access through a standard file
   system interface for seamless integration. Amazon EFS is a regional service storing data within and
   across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) for high availability and durability. You can access
   your file systems across Availability Zones and AWS Regions and share files between thousands
   of Amazon EC2 instances and on-premises servers via AWS Direct Connect or AWS VPN.
     </p>
     <p>
      Amazon EFS is well suited to support a broad spectrum of use cases from highly parallelized,
   scale-out workloads that require the highest possible throughput to single-threaded,
   latency-sensitive workloads. Use cases such as lift-and-shift enterprise applications, big data
   analytics, web serving and content management, application development and testing, media and
   entertainment workflows, database backups, and container storage.
     </p>
     <p>
      For long-lived data that is accessed only a few times a year or less, consider Amazon EFS
   Archive, a cost-effective way to retain even your coldest data so that it's always available to
   power new business insights. Amazon EFS Archive supports the same intelligent tiering experience as
   existing EFS storage classes. This means that you can combine the sub-millisecond SSD latencies
   of Amazon EFS Standard for your active frequently-accessed data with the lower costs of Amazon EFS IA and
   Amazon EFS Archive for your colder data.
